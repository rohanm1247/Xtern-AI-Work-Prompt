You will be graded largely on your intent and process when designing the model, performance is secondary. It is strongly suggested that you use SKLearn for this model as to not take too much time.  You may use any kind implementation you would like though, but it must be pickelable and have a “.predict()” method similar to SKLearn

The file 'Answers' contains the answers to this segment: (10%) Given the work required to bring a solution like this to maturity and its performance, what considerations would you make to determine if this is a suitable course of action?
